    "The following data was scraped from [sofifa.com](https://sofifa.com/), a website dedicated to collecting information from FIFA video games. The dataset consists of all players in FIFA 22 and their corresponding attributes. We have truncated the dataset to a limited number of rows (100) to ease with our visualizations and analysis. Since we’re learning about linear regression, we will look specifically for a linear association between various player attributes. **To help with understanding where the line of best fit generated in linear regression comes from please do not use the `.fit_line` argument in `.scatter` at any point on question 2 unless the code was provided for you.**\n",
